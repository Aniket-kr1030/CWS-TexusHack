To create a database for the FinBuddy app, you'll first need to decide on the type of database you want to use. For a mobile application, a combination of cloud-based and local databases is often ideal. A cloud-based database, such as Firebase or AWS, ensures data synchronization between devices and allows for easy backups, while a local database, such as SQLite or Realm, provides offline functionality.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved in creating a database for the FinBuddy app:

Determine database requirements:

Identify the types of data the app will store, such as user profiles, transactions, budgets, savings goals, and financial insights.
Determine the relationships between the different data types and decide on the appropriate database schema.
Choose the technology stack:

Select a cloud-based database platform, such as Firebase or AWS, for data synchronization and backups.
Select a local database technology, such as SQLite or Realm, for offline functionality.
Design the database schema:

Create tables or collections for each data type and define their attributes.
Establish relationships between tables or collections using primary and foreign keys or document references.
Example schema for FinBuddy:

Users:

user_id (primary key)
name
email
password_hash
phone_number
created_at
updated_at
Transactions:

transaction_id (primary key)
user_id (foreign key)
category_id (foreign key)
amount
date
payment_method
note
receipt_image
created_at
updated_at
Categories:

category_id (primary key)
name
icon
Budgets:

budget_id (primary key)
user_id (foreign key)
category_id (foreign key)
amount
start_date
end_date
recurring_frequency
created_at
updated_at
SavingsGoals:

goal_id (primary key)
user_id (foreign key)
name
target_amount
current_amount
due_date
created_at
updated_at
Implement the database:

Set up the chosen cloud-based database platform and create the required tables or collections.
Configure the app to use the chosen local database technology and create the required tables or collections.
Create data access functions for adding, updating, deleting, and querying data from the database.
Secure the database:

Implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that users can only access their own data.
Use encryption for sensitive data, such as passwords, and ensure secure transmission of data between the app and the database.
Test the database:

Test the database by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each data type.
Test the synchronization between the local and cloud-based databases.
Perform load testing to ensure the database can handle the expected number of users and concurrent connections.
By following these steps, you can create a robust and secure database for the FinBuddy app that meets its requirements for data storage, synchronization, and accessibility.
